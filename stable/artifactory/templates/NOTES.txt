Congratulations. You have just deployed JFrog Artifactory Pro!

1. Get the Artifactory URL by running these commands:

   NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
         You can watch the status of the service by running 'kubectl get svc -w {{ .Values.nx_name }}'

   export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Values.nx_name }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   export ARTIFACTORY_DNS=artifactory.local

2. If you want to access your Artifactory using an alias or a qualified host and domain,
   add the Artifactory IP to your network's DNS or your local /etc/hosts

   sudo sh -c "echo \"${SERVICE_IP} ${ARTIFACTORY_DNS}\" >> /etc/hosts"

3. Open Artifactory in your browser

   http://${ARTIFACTORY_DNS}/artifactory
